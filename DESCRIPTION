Description: This package was based on the ClusTCR application in python. This program using one edit distance (hamming distance) to identify if the complement-determining region three (CDR3) in the hypervariable section of the T cell receptor (TCR) have a similar seqeunce. This also takes into cosideration the variable gene (v_gene) as well from the same length. The second part of the package using the Markov Cluster Algorithm (MCL) to identify the clusters in an undirected graph. This outputs the summmary of the amino acid motif and a network plot. This package was built for single cell RNA-seq with TCR-seq data and is incorporated into the Single cell TCR and Expression Grouped Ontologies (STEGO) shiny R application.
